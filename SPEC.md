​
## Overview
​
The second project is to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**.
​
### Technical Requirements
​
Your app must:
​
* **Consume a public API** – this could be anything but it must make sense for  your project.
* **Be built with React and React Router** - with several different pages. A good model for this is an index page to show a list of items, and the show page, for a single item. But it's up to you.
* **Include logic to filter or search or sort the data in some way**.
* **Use Local Storage to store data on the frontend** - it is up to you what you store.
* **Use at least one new library/package of your own choosing** - this requirement encourages you to make use of the npm ecosystem to add functionality to your project. It can be something very small!

## Necessary Deliverables
​
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
    * A paragraph or two about the **general approach you took**
    * Brief **instructions** for how to install dependencies and run your project
    * A screenshot of your working app
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

## Suggested Ways to Get Started
​
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / APIs you use**.
* **Write DRY code**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.**
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

## Project End
​
* There will be a presentation on Friday morning, where you'll be presenting your app to the group, what your app does, and what were the major obstacles you faced.
